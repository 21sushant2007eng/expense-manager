# expense-manager
Expense Manager is a simple Python-based application designed to help users track and analyze their daily expenses. This was my first Python project, created to practice basic fundamentals of python. The application allows users to record expenses, calculate total spending, view expense history, and identify the most expensive purchase.

## 📌 Project Overview
The application allows users to add expenses with a category and amount, calculate total spending, view expense history, and identify the most expensive purchase.  
It uses simple data structures and algorithms to manage and analyze expense data in a clear and structured way.

### Features
- Add expenses with category and amount  
- Store expense records using dictionaries inside a list  
- Calculate total expenses using summation logic  
- Find the most expensive expense using comparison logic  
- View expense history in reverse order (latest first)  
- Menu-driven interface for easy interaction

#### Concepts Used
- Lists and Dictionaries  
- Functions and Modular Programming  
- Loops
- Conditional Statements
- Basic algorithms (summation, maximum value, reversal)
